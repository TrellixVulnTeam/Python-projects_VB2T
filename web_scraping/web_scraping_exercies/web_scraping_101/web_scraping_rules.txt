Web scraping rules you should remember based on Greg Reda's blog (http://www.gregreda.com/2013/03/03/web-scraping-101-with-python/)

- You should check a site's terms and conditions before you scrape them. 
- It's their data and they likely have some rules to govern it.
- Be nice - A computer will send web requests much quicker than a user can. 
- Make sure you space out your requests a bit so that you don't hammer the site's server.
- Scrapers break - Sites change their layout all the time. If that happens, be prepared to rewrite your code.
- Web pages are inconsistent - There's sometimes some manual clean up that has to happen even after you've gotten your data.

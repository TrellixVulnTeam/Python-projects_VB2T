I found this data-puzzle provided by Hopper Inc when looking at their data analyst and data scientist role.


## About
Hopper Inc. is the maker behind the flight-booking app that predicts the price of flights up to a year in advance with 95 per cent accuracy by using algorithms capable of analyzing massive amounts of data. Depending on the price of tickets when a search is made, Hopper advises users whether they should buy immediately or wait for a better price. The application will then send the user a notification when the flight is at its lowest predicted price.

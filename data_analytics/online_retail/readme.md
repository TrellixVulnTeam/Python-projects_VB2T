## Objective

explore the use of Recency, Frequency and Monetary (R_F_M) analysis on the [Online retail dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail) retail dataset. The goal of this analysis is to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (recency), how often they purchase (frequency), and how much the customer spends (monetary). R_F_M analysis is based on the marketing axiom that "80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers." The R_F_M will be used for business

#After refueling your space ship at a particularly sketchy space gas station, the chief engineer notices that the engines are 
#behaving abnormally.He thinks that the captain may have been scammed, and that the fuel has been cut with a less efficient isotope. 
#As the lead analyst on the ship, you're given the engineer's data. Your mission now is to determine if the fuel has truly been 
#contaminated, and to recommend an appropriate course of action.
#
#Step 1: Create the models.
#
#Download the engineer's data of the fuel's decay, and fit two linear regression models. 
#First, with the uncontaminated equation N(t)=A r_1 e^{-r_1 t}+C, and 
#second with the contaminated equation N(t)=A r_1 e^{-r_1 t}+B r_2 e^{-r_2 t}+C. A and B represent the amount of good 
#and bad fuel, and C represents background radiation. The decay rates r1 and r2 are 0.4 and 0.1, respectively.
#
#Step 2: Choose the more likely model.
#Perform a likelihood-ratio test with the two models, and compare the test statistic to a chi-squared distribution. 
#What's the probability that the peculiarities in the data are due to random chance? If you're using the statsmodels module, 
#you can easily access the log-likelihood of the regressions through the llf attribute of the fitted model.
#
#Step 3: Quantify the contamination.
#
#Calculate B/(A+B) to determine what percentage of the fuel supply was contaminated, 
#along with the associated uncertainty of the value. If you're using the statsmodels module, 
#you can use the bse attribute of the fitted models to get the errors of the parameters. If the contamination is more than 20%,
# you'll need to refuel before reaching your next destination.
